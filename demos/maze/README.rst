Demo of Maze Solving
====================
Getting the D-Wave quantum computer to solve a maze!

The following code takes a simple and familiar problem---solving a maze---and demonstrates the steps
of submitting such problems to the quantum computer.

Code Overview
-------------
The solution technique is to construct a set of constraints that enforces the rules of moving
through a maze. These constraints are then converted by Ocean software tools to a binary
quadratic model (BQM) that can then be solved with a D-Wave quantum computer. The solution that gets
returned by the quantum computer is the path needed to get through the maze.

There are several constraints involved with a maze:

- Valid path movements (i.e., if the path enters a grid point, it must also leave said grid point)
- Path has a specific start and end position
- Path cannot pass maze borders
- Path cannot pass through the internal walls of the maze

Each of these constraints are implemented by the :code:`maze` functions:
:code:`_apply_valid_move_constraint()`, :code:`_set_start_and_end()`, :code:`_set_borders()`, and
:code:`_set_inner_walls()`, respectively. These functions are called when the user calls
:code:`get_maze_bqm(..)` in the Example section below.

Code Specifics
--------------
The maze is a rectangular grid. The path segments (aka edges) that can be formed in this grid are
described with respect to a grid point. For example, the edge labelled :code:`'1,0w'`:

- :code:`1,0` refers to grid point on row 1, column 0
- :code:`w` refers to "west"

Hence, if you imagine a compass that is centered at position :code:`1,0`, the edge :code:`'1,0w'`
is the path segment that sits along the western direction of this compass.

Note that the code only accepts edge inputs in the north direction (:code:`'<row>,<col>n'`) and the
west direction (:code:`'<row>,<col>w'`). Edges in south or east directions can be restated as edges
in north and west directions:

.. code-block:: none

  '<row>,<col>s' == '<row+1>,<col>n'
  '<row>,<col>e' == '<row>,<col+1>w'

Example
-------
.. code-block:: python

  from maze import get_maze_bqm
  from dwave.system.samplers import DWaveSampler
  from dwave.system.composites import EmbeddingComposite

  # Create maze
  n_rows = 2
  n_cols = 2
  start = '0,0n'
  end = '1,0w'
  walls = ['1,1n']

  # Get BQM
  bqm = get_maze_bqm(n_rows, n_cols, start, end, walls)

  # Submit BQM to a D-Wave sampler
  sampler = EmbeddingComposite(DWaveSampler())
  result = sampler.sample(bqm, num_reads=1000)
  print(result)

.. code-block:: none

     1,0n  0,1w  1,1w  energy  num_occ.  chain_b.
  0     1     0     0    -3.5      1000       0.0

Printed results:

- The 1s and 0s beneath each path segment indicate whether or not the segment is included in the path.
  Specifically, 1 indicates that the segment contributes to the path, while 0 indicates otherwise.
- As shown above, :code:`'1,0n'` is a segment that is needed in our tiny maze path
- Hence, the path from start to end is :code:`'0,0n' -> '1,0n' -> '1,0w'`
